# TapLRecreationDiscordBot
This is the bot we use on our discord server.
To use this bot add your bot token to your env file.
Currently most of it is hard coded so you will have to put your channel IDs in the code and then compile.

I didn't make this for general purpose use I just made it for the server and swipez told me to make it open source so here it is. 
Enjoy and feel free to reach out to me for any questions in our discord server, you can ping @YHDiamond (me)
